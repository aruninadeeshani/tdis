Geometry functions for TDIS mTPC detector.

This module provides functions to calculate positions and geometry
of the detector components, particularly the pad arrangements.


The mTPC will consist of 10 separate TPC volumes which will be assembled together to form the mTPC. The entire
detector will be 55 cm long with an annulus of inner radius of 5 cm and an outer radius of 15 cm.

```

The pads are arranged into 21 concentric rings, each with a radial with of 10 cm/21.
The rings are numbered from 0 to 20 sequentially, with 0 being the innermost ring.
Each ring has 122 pads, yielding a total of 2 562 pads per readout plane
and a total of 25 620 readout pads if all 10 chambers of the mTPC are instrumented.
The φ angle of each pad is as defined in the Lab coordinate system.
For even rings the centre of pad 0 is located at φ = 0◦.
Whereas for odd rings the center is shifted by a half of pad angle, i.e. is at φ = 0.5×2π/122 =∼ 0.02575◦.
Since the ring widths and number of pads per ring are fixed,
the pads are rectangular with a different aspect ratio for each ring, depending on the radius,
i.e. smaller pads are located at the innermost radii.
